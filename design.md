### 1. Architectural Design

Defines the system structure and component relationships:

* Frontend layer (UI and user interaction)
* Backend layer (APIs, logic, services)
* AI/Processing layer (intelligence, automation, learning models)
* Database layer (data storage and synchronization)
* Hardware/Device layer (input/output interfaces)

### 2. Visual Design

Defines how the system looks and feels:

* User interface layout
* Interaction flow
* Navigation structure
* Accessibility and usability
* Human-centered design approach

### 3. Functional Design

Defines what the system does:

* Core features and modules
* User actions and system responses
* Data flow and processing logic
* Automation and AI behavior
* Error handling and fallback flows

## Role in Development

This design model acts as a reference framework for:

* System architecture diagrams
* Use-case diagrams
* Process flow diagrams
* UI/UX wireframes
* Feature mapping
* Technical documentation

## Summary

The design blueprint is a complete representation of the system’s structure, behavior, and interaction model. It provides a unified view of how the software is built, how it operates, and how users engage with it, serving as the foundation for development and implementation.
